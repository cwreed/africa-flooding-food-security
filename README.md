# Flooding and food security in Sub-Saharan Africa

This repository contains the source code for our analysis of where and to what extent flooding impacts food security in Sub-Saharan Africa. We make use of econometric time series analysis techniques, including static panel regression and panel Granger causality, to quantify the effects of floods on the integrated food security phase classification (IPC) metric at the place of their occurrence up to roughly a year after their onset.  

This work is accompanied by qualitative case study analysis in our paper, which can be cited as follows:
